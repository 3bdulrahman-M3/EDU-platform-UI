# Role-Based Course Platform Frontend Implementation

This document outlines the complete implementation of a role-based course platform frontend using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## 🎯 Overview

The platform supports two user roles:

- **Instructors**: Can create courses and manage student enrollments
- **Students**: Can browse, enroll in, and withdraw from courses

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. RoleBasedRoute Component

- **Location**: `src/components/RoleBasedRoute.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Protects routes based on user role
- **Features**:
  - Checks authentication status
  - Validates user role against allowed roles
  - Redirects to unauthorized page if access denied
  - Shows loading state during authentication check

#### 2. Enhanced CourseCard Component

- **Location**: `src/components/CourseCard.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Displays course information with role-specific actions
- **Features**:
  - Different actions based on user role (enroll/withdraw for students, view students for instructors)
  - Enrollment status indicators
  - Loading states for actions
  - Responsive design

#### 3. Updated API Layer

- **Location**: `src/lib/api.ts`
- **Purpose**: Centralized API calls with role-based endpoints
- **Features**:
  - Instructor-specific API functions
  - Student-specific API functions
  - Authentication handling
  - Error handling

## 🎨 User Interface

### Instructor Features

#### 1. Instructor Dashboard (`/instructor`)

- **Features**:
  - Overview statistics (total courses, active students, enrollments)
  - List of created courses
  - Quick access to create new courses
  - Course management actions

#### 2. Create Course Page (`/instructor/courses/create`)

- **Features**:
  - Form for course title and description
  - Image upload with preview
  - Validation and error handling
  - Redirect to dashboard after creation

#### 3. Course Students Page (`/instructor/courses/[id]/students`)

- **Features**:
  - Tabbed interface for enrolled vs withdrawn students
  - Student information display
  - Enrollment date tracking
  - Responsive student cards

### Student Features

#### 1. Student Dashboard (`/student`)

- **Features**:
  - Overview of enrolled courses
  - Learning statistics
  - Quick access to course discovery
  - Progress tracking

#### 2. Course Discovery (`/courses`)

- **Features**:
  - Search functionality
  - Filter out already enrolled courses
  - Newest courses first
  - Enrollment/withdrawal actions
  - Responsive course grid

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control

- **Protected Routes**: All role-specific pages are protected
- **Navigation**: Dynamic navigation based on user role
- **API Calls**: Role-specific endpoints with proper authentication
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of unauthorized access

### User Experience

- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders and spinners
- **Error States**: User-friendly error messages
- **Success Feedback**: Visual confirmation of actions
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Mobile-First Approach

- **Navigation**: Collapsible mobile menu
- **Cards**: Responsive grid layouts
- **Forms**: Touch-friendly inputs
- **Actions**: Accessible buttons and links

### Breakpoints

- **Mobile**: < 768px
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px
- **Desktop**: > 1024px

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Design System

- **Colors**: Consistent color palette with primary, secondary, and accent colors
- **Typography**: Hierarchical text system
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing scale
- **Components**: Reusable component library

### Interactive Elements

- **Hover Effects**: Subtle animations and transitions
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders and spinners
- **Error Handling**: Toast notifications and inline errors
- **Success Feedback**: Visual confirmation of actions

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management

- **Context API**: Authentication state management
- **Local State**: Component-level state for forms and UI
- **API State**: Loading, error, and success states

### Data Flow

1. **Authentication**: User login/register → AuthContext update
2. **Role Detection**: User role determines available features
3. **API Calls**: Role-specific endpoints with proper headers
4. **UI Updates**: Real-time updates based on user actions

### Error Handling

- **Network Errors**: Graceful fallbacks and retry mechanisms
- **Validation Errors**: Form validation with user feedback
- **Authorization Errors**: Redirect to appropriate pages
- **General Errors**: User-friendly error messages

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Backend API running on `http://localhost:8000`

### Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

## 📋 API Endpoints Used

### Instructor Endpoints

- `POST /api/courses/` - Create course
- `GET /api/instructor/courses/` - Get instructor's courses
- `GET /api/instructor/courses/:id/students/` - Get enrolled students
- `GET /api/instructor/courses/:id/withdrawn/` - Get withdrawn students

### Student Endpoints

- `GET /api/courses/` - Get newest courses
- `POST /api/courses/:id/enroll/` - Enroll in course
- `POST /api/courses/:id/withdraw/` - Withdraw from course
- `GET /api/student/courses/` - Get enrolled courses

### General Endpoints

- `POST /api/auth/login/` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/register/` - User registration
- `GET /api/auth/user/` - Get current user

## 🧪 Testing Considerations

### User Flows

1. **Instructor Flow**: Register → Login → Create Course → View Students
2. **Student Flow**: Register → Login → Browse Courses → Enroll → Withdraw
3. **Role Switching**: Test unauthorized access attempts

### Edge Cases

- **Network Failures**: Test offline scenarios
- **Invalid Data**: Test form validation
- **Authorization**: Test role-based access
- **Performance**: Test with large datasets

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Potential Features

- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live updates
- **Advanced Search**: Filters by category, difficulty, duration
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed learning analytics
- **Notifications**: Email and in-app notifications
- **Mobile App**: React Native implementation

### Technical Improvements

- **Caching**: React Query for better data management
- **PWA**: Progressive Web App features
- **SEO**: Server-side rendering for better SEO
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite
- **Performance**: Code splitting and optimization
